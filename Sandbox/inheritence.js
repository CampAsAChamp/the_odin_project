//  2) Prototype Attribute: Accessing Properties on Objects

var myFriends = { name: "Pete" };

// To find the name property below, the search will begin directly on the myFriends object and will immediately find the name property because we defined the property name on the myFriend object. This could be thought of as a prototype chain with one link.
console.log(myFriends.name);

// In this example, the search for the toString () method will also begin on the myFriends’ object, but because we never created a toString method on the myFriends object, the compiler will then search for it on the myFriends prototype (the object which it inherited its properties from).

// And since all objects created with the object literal inherits from Object.prototype, the toString method will be found on Object.prototype—see important note below for all properties inherited from Object.prototype.

console.log(myFriends.toString());
