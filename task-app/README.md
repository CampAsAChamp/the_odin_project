# Tasks Array

- Your application should render an input field and a submit button. 
- With the submit button, you can add the content from your input to a “tasks array” that is managed in state. (We will use class components for this example because we haven’t introduced hooks in this section yet). 
- Finally, for each task in the tasks array, an HTML list element should be rendered.
